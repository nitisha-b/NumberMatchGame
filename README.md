# Number Match Game

Followed through a course on LinkedIn Learning to learn the basics of JavaScript and create a game using **p5js**. 

## Game Description

This is a simple game where you try to correctly press the digits on your keypad as shown on the screen. You have 3 failed attempts until the game is over. You can continue to play as long as you press the correct keys. When the game is over, it tells you the number of attempts you got correct, and you can press _ENTER_ to start again.
